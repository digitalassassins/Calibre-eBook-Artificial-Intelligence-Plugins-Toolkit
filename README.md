# Calibre eBook Artificial Intelligence Toolkit Plugin Pack

Artificial Intelligence Plugins for Calibre eBook Software

The Calibre eBook community seems petrified of Artificial Intelligence.
I had a massive collection of eBooks that needed organising for a RAG system, so I checked and there was no software available online to sort and organise eBook metadata. 
Calibre was a good option as it allows you to download and embed metadata inside the files. There was a huge collection of my eBooks, which were Rare, out of Print, and self-published.
Where simply no metadata was available anywhere on the internet. I faced a humongous uphill battle of manually editing the metadata for hundreds of thousands of eBooks.

I looked for ways to tackle this problem, I searched for solutions using n8n and other AI toolkits, but nothing suited my needs.
So I set out to design a plugin for Calibre that could send each eBook from Calibre to a Local LLM. I had designed a rudimentary plugin, and it worked great, better than great, it worked perfectly.
I clicked a single button and this set the job running, then after a few hours, all my missing metadata was completed.
I thought this was great. I work for a company, and we don't normally give our software away for free.
But I had developed this in my spare time and thought I would give it back to the community by letting people use it for free.

I then visited the site mobilereads.com, which is a community for eBook readers and is the official forum for Calibre eBook software.
When I mentioned that I had built a plugin for artificial intelligence, I was greeted with a frosty reception from people who opposed Artificial Intelligence.
Including the main developer of Calibre, who doesn't believe in Artificial Intelligence.
He said to me, "Artificial Intelligence has the IQ of a 3-day-old corpse".

So I pressed ahead anyway to modify the plugin to include a settings page, useful for other users of the plugin, and I was getting it ready for release.
When I returned to the MobileReads forum, I realised I had been shadow-banned and couldn't post to the forum. which I found a little strange.

So when it was time to release the plugin, I skipped the MobileReads forum as I knew I couldn't release the plugin officially, I posted the plugin pack to the Calibre Reddit page.
Within seconds of the Plugin pack being posted to the Calibre Reddit page, it had already received 100s of downvotes from their community, which seemed odd, but I thought that as time passed, more average users might stumble upon the plugin pack and find it useful. It started gaining traction, so even though they had downvoted the post to oblivion. Others were finding it useful.

Then I received a notification that my post had breached Calibre Reddit group's terms and conditions, and my account had been banned. The post was a collection of screenshots of the plugin, plus a link to a user guide and to download the plugin pack.

I never realised that people in an open-source community could be so hostile to others just trying to help their community.

Possibly with all the press about authors taking AI companies to court, maybe they see me as the enemy from within?
Maybe they are so far behind the curve, they don't realise there is a curve?

Anyway, with being stopped at every turn from actually getting the plugins out there for people to use, I thought I would post the plugin toolkit to GitHub, somewhere they can't control.
No doubt, they will post a removal request to GitHub or something to try and have it removed.
Hopefully, others will find these plugins as useful as I did; they are free to download, use and modify to your heart's content.

I will also post the user guide. When I have some free time, I will post the full user guide to this readme, so you don't have to visit an external site.
